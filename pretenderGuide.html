<h2>So Wanna build a pretender, do you?</h2>

<h4>Pretenders are the gods that fight for dominion over the land. They imbue the earth they hold holy providence over with a magical climate.<br>
Those considered sacred by the nation can be blessed with holy strength by priests as they go into war, and the pretender himself can be a powerful warrior.<br>
<br>
With this in mind, making a pretender that fits the nations gameplan is a vital part of playing dominions 4</h4>

<h3>Magical Paths</h3>

<h4>Magical paths on a pretender play two important roles on a pretender.<br>
The first one, is obvious, and that's the paths themselves the pretender has as a mage.<br>
The second one the for a bless. Every path gives a minor bless at level 4 and a major bless at level 9.<br>
And between leve 4 and 9 the minor bless scales upwards, to a max of 10.<br></h4>

<h3> Water </h3>
<h4> Minor Bless: +2 defence with +1 defence every second level thereafter.<br>
Major Bless: PseudoQuickness. Unit has twice as much AP as well as an extra turn every other turn. Stacks with Quickness.<br>
<br>
This bless is best for units that already have high defence (sacred cav or Warriors of the Five Elements) and Elves which make use of glamour.</h4>
