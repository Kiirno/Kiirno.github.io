<h2>So wanna build a pretender, do you?</h2>

<h4>Pretenders are the gods that fight for dominion over the land. They imbue the earth they hold holy providence over with a magical climate.<br>
Those considered sacred by the nation can be blessed with holy strength by priests as they go into war, and the pretender himself can be a powerful warrior.<br>
<br>
With this in mind, making a pretender that fits the nations gameplan is a vital part of playing dominions 4</h4>

<h3>Magical Paths</h3>

<h4>Magical paths play two important roles on a pretender.<br>
The first one, is obvious, and that's the paths themselves the pretender has as a mage.<br>
The second one is for a bless. Every path gives a minor bless at level 4 which scales up, and a major bless at level 9.<br></h4>

<h3> Air </h3>
<h4> Minor Bless: +20% range with +5% range every level thereafter and +2 precision with +1 precision every second level thereafter.<br>
Major Bless: Air Shield(80). Stop 80% of mundane missiles that would otherwise have struck the unit.<br>
<br>
The minor bless is decent on sacred mages.<br>
Nobody uses the major bless, it's shit.</h4>

<h3> Astral </h3>
<h4> Minor Bless: +1 magic resist every level after 3. Caps at 18 magic resist.<br>
Major Bless: Twist Fate. Negates the first successful hit that would have otherwise struck the unit.<br>
<br>
The bless is best for units with high defence or glamour.</h4>

<h3> Blood </h3>
<h4> Minor Bless: +2 strength with +1 strength every other level.<br>
Major Bless: Blood Vengence. A unit which deals damage to this unit must make a resist magic 10 roll or take that damage dealt in magic damage. </h4>

<h3> Death </h3>
<h4> Minor Bless: +4 Undying with +1 undying every level after.<br>
Undying lets your units enter negative hp before dying. So a unit with Undying(5) will only die at -6hp.
Unless Undead, a unit with negative hp will die once the battle is over.<br>
Major Bless: Death Weapons. On hit weapons inflict an addition 2AN magical damage which diseases. </h4>

<h3> Earth </h3>
<h4> Minor Bless: +2 reinvigoration with +1 every other level.<br>
Major Bless: +5 Natural Protection.</h4>



<h3> Water </h3>
<h4> Minor Bless: +2 defence with +1 defence every second level thereafter.<br>
Major Bless: PseudoQuickness. Unit has twice as much AP as well as an extra turn every other turn.<br>
<br>
This bless is best for units that already have high defence (sacred cav or Warriors of the Five Elements) and Elves which make use of glamour.<br>
Other units with multiple attacks can make good use of pesudo-quickness.<br>
<br>
</h4>


<h3> Fire </h3>
<h4> Minor Bless: +2 attack with +1 attack every second level thereafter.<br>
Major Bless: Fire Weapons. As a secondary effect weapons will deal 6ap damage.<br>
<br>
This bless is best for units that have multiple attacks like Vanheims Vanhere or T'ien Ch'is Warrior of the Five Elements.<br>
