<h2>So wanna build a pretender, do you?</h2>

<h4>Pretenders are the gods that fight for dominion over the land. They imbue the earth they hold holy providence over with a magical climate.<br>
Those considered sacred by the nation can be blessed with holy strength by priests as they go into war, and the pretender himself can be a powerful warrior.<br>
<br>
With this in mind, making a pretender that fits the nations gameplan is a vital part of playing dominions 4</h4>

<h3>Magical Paths</h3>

<h4>Magical paths play two important roles on a pretender.<br>
The first one, is obvious, and that's the paths themselves the pretender has as a mage.<br>
The second one the for a bless. Every path gives a minor bless at level 4 and a major bless at level 9.<br>
And between leve 4 and 9 the minor bless scales upwards, to a max of 10.<br></h4>

<h3> Air </h3>
<h4> Minor Bless: +20% range with +5% range every level thereafter and +2 precision with +1 precision every second level thereafter.<br>
Major Bless: Air Shield(80). Stop 80% of mundane missiles that would otherwise have struck the unit.<br>
<br>
Nobody uses this bless, it's shit.</h4>

<h3> Astral </h3>
<h4> Minor Bless: +1 magic resist every level after 3. Caps at 18 magic resist.<br>
Major Bless: Twist Fate. Negates the first successful hit that would have otherwise struck the unit.<br>
