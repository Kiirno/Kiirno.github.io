<h3>PotNS</h3>
<p>Portmanteau for casting Light of the Northern Star and Power of the Spheres together.</p>

<h3>Income </h3>
<p> income = {floor((pop+10*defence)/100) * [1+.05*order] * [1+.05*temp] * [1+.03*Growth] * [1+.02*Prod ]}/(1+(unrest*0.02)) - max(0, sum(admin) - .5) </p>

<h3>Effective Fort Cost</h3>
<p>The cost necessary to make a useful fort.<br>
Most nations require a lab to make their forts useful.<br>
Some nations require only a temple, such as mictlan.<br>
Other nations require both a temple and a lab in their forts,<br>
making their Effective Fort Cost very high.<br>
<br>
Sauromatia needs neither a lab nor a temple to make soothsayers.<br>
This means that their effective fort cost is rather low.<br>
Excellent reason to spam forts on every province you own.</p>

<h3>Fortune Teller</h3>
<p>Fortune Teller is a skill all Enari and Soothsayers possess.<br>
Whenever a bad event happens in a particular province, every Enari and every Soothsayer in that province has a 5% chance to stop it.<br>
The chance that an event is stopped is exactly <math>(1-0.95^n)</math>% where n = # of fortune tellers.</p>

<h3>Terminology for Scaling Spells</h3>
<p>When an Y pathed spell is marked as having M+ effects, this is to mean<br>
that the spell will have an extra effect for every path the casting mage has above Y.<br>
Similarly M++ gives an extra two effects.<br>
<br>
For example, Horde of Skeletons is a D2 spell which summons 6+ skeletons.<br>
So an Enari that's currently at D4 will summon 8 skeletons with every cast of Horde of Skeletons.</p>

<h3>Mercenaries</h3>
<p>Mercs are p. good. They tend to pay for themselves quickly enough.</p>

<h3>Screening</h3>
<p>Say someone is digging into your territory with some big bad.<br>
They only have so many gems on them.<br>
<br>
To whittle down on their supply you send one of your immortal vampires to fight them with some blood slaves.<br>
This will trigger all their gem usage lowering their magical strength for upcoming battles.

This is screening.</p>

<h3>Evo Catching</h3>
<p>Evo Catching is when you place a unit far ahead, preferably one that is large with a good deal of hp, <br>
in order to lure evocations away from your more delicate troops.<br>
Vine Ogres make for some of the most cost effective evo catchers in the game.</p>

<h3>1Comm </h3>
<p>A communion which defaults to 1fat spells after scripting</p>

<h3>Communions</h3>
<p>Sauromatia is a nation of communion.<br>
Your bread and butter as Sauromatia will be a Skelespamming 1Comm<br>
Given a soothsayer castin’ Power of the Spheres, the slaves will have more spell paths than the casting <br>
masters, thus fatigue is cut in half. This will have the slaves incurring a 1 fatigue per spell cast, <br>
even in drain 2, which is enough to last a battle.<br>
<br>
Note: Communion Slaves and Master can be at any distance of each other, anywhere on the battlefield.<br>
Similarly for Sabbath Slaves and Masters. Interestingly, Blood Slaves follow a weaker but similar rule.<br>
A blood mage may use friendly slaves from within 8 squares inclusive on the battlefield, even those he does not hold.<br>
<br>
<br>
Natural order of Enari artillery should be:
	<ol>
		<li>2 Soothsayer / 2 Enari Turbo Comm
			<ul><li>Fatigue per Turn: Turbo Stable.</li></ul></li>
		<li>4 Enari / 5 Enari Comm
			<ul><li>Fatigue per Turn: 12</li></ul></li>
		<li>2 Enari / 5 Enari (+ 2 Soothsayer) PotNS Comm
			<ul><li>Fatigue per Turn: 12</li></ul></li>
		<li>4 Enari / 10 Enari (+ 2 Soothsayer) PotNS Comm
			<ul><li>Fatigue per Turn: 10</li></ul></li>
		<li>4 Enari / 12 Enari (+ 2 Soothsayer, + 1 Witch King) PotNS Relief Comm
			<ul><li>Fatigue per Turn: 11.5 (Have the Witch King cast reinvigorate)</li></ul></li>
	</ol>
Clammed Soothsayers should be given bows and set on fire so the slaves don't incur fatigue from cascade spam.

</p>

<h3>Turbo Communions</h3>

<p>Once communion slaves hit the 200 fatigue they start taking damage at a rate of 1hp for every 50 points of fatigue, rounded up.<br> 
Normally in a stable communion you want to keep this off for as long as possible, by finding ways of lowering the fatigue per spell and increasing the slaves' reinvigoration.<br> 
<br>
However sometimes you can just say fuck it, and take the blows. These are turbo communions.<br> 
The point of a turbo communion is for your slaves to regenerate HP faster than they get damaged from spellcasting fatigue.
Generally this is not recommended as it gives a hard (and low) upper cap on how many masters you can field.<br> 
<br>
Consider this setup:<br>
2 Enari as masters, and 2 Soothsayers as slaves.<br> 
Every Horde of Skeletons cast will put back each slave by 28 points of fatigue.<br> 
In only 4 turns the slaves will be at 200 fatigue, not ideal.<br> 
However if you enlarge the slaves and cast personal regen on the master, the slaves will be healing 2hp per turn, as many hit points as there are masters.<br> 
This means the communion is “turbo stable” and will last the duration of the fight.<br> 
Care must be taken as the Enari casting enlarge must be in the same square as the two soothsayers.<br>
<br>
A turbocomm with 40 archers is able to kill Bogus and co.</p>

<h4>TurboRaid</h4>
<p>A raiding party that consists of a turbo communion and a small squad of Cataphracts or Archers.</p>

<h3>Super Huge Communions</h3>
<p>A super big communion is defined as a communion that's huge, like xbox huge.<br>
We will consider 4+/16+ enari communions, generating 120+ skeletals per turn.<br>
Let's go over the main ingredients for this recipe.<br>
<ul>
	<li>1 Soothsayer casting PotS, then Fire Closest with a bow of your choosing. (Black or Bane Venom recommended)</li>
	<li>1 Earth Indie casting Earthpower(+4 reinvig), then Fire Closest with a bow.</li>
	<li>A massive number of Enari.</li>
	<li>A nature random Witch King casting Relief(+2.5 reinvig), hold, hold, hold, Reinvigorate, then Cast Spells.</li>
</ul>

Let R = # of masters - Total Expected Reinvig + {# of Witch Kings if # of Slaves < 6}<br>
The number of turns a large communion can stand is expected to be (100/R)+(100/(R-5))+5<br>
With the notable expection that if R &le; 0 then the communion is fatigue-stable.<br>
An example of a Super Big Communion would be a 4/16 core communion with 1 Soothsayer, 1 Witch King, and one Witch.<br>
In this case R = 16 - 6.5 + 1 = 10.5. So the communion will last an expected (100/10.5)+(100/(10.5-5))+5 = 32 turns.<br>
That is, this communion will cast 137 longdead every turn for 32 turns.<br>
<br>
The research required for this is Const4, Ench6, Conj3 and Thaum1. So early midgame.</p>

<h2> Battlefield Strategy </h2>

<h3>Main Mage Battery</h3>

<h3>PotNS Group </h3>
<p>Placed somewhere in the back to cast PotNS and various other spells.</p>

<p>The Banefire Crossbow is to make sure he doesnt eat up skeleton casting fatigue</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>Warrior Sorceress Thug Group </h3> 
<img src="images/annex/thuglyfe.png" alt="thuglyfe"><br>
<p>Warrior sorceresses are rather good light thugs when placed into armies. <br>
With a W and E minor they can handle themselves quite well while flanked by friendly skeletons.</p>
<img src="images/annex/castingthuglyfe.png" alt="castingthuglyfe" align="left" style="margin:0 10px 0 20px;"><br>
<p>To do this, place a soothsayer in the same square as they are, casting Body Ethereal, Cheat Fate and Luck.<br> 
The WS in turn can cast Barkskin and Bless. <br>
<br>
<br>
However without the soothsayer and skeleton support these light thugs can quickly get surrounded and killed.<br> 
They can raid with the help of a couple of Enari.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-style:italic; color:grey; font-size:.8em;"> &emsp; - A soothsayer covering a sorceress in his “pixie dust”. </p>
<br>
<img src="images/annex/rebornthuglyfe.png" alt="rebornthuglyfe">
<p>Suited with a W6E6 bless, such a thug can easily accumulate experience, further increasing her defence.</p>

<h3 id="thugBlock">Thug Block</h3>
<p>Witness, for I have made ND Warrior Sorceresses useful.<br>
For this you will need one N2 Warrior Sorceress with a Thistle Mace, one NW Warrior Sorceress with a Water Bracelet,<br>
and anywhere between 1 and 4 Warrior Sorceresses to buff into thugs.<br>
<br>
Begin by kitting out your Thug Block by giving the appropriate boosters and Frost Brands to any Warrior Sorceresses you plan on thugging.
<img src="images/thug/thugBlocWeps.png" alt="thugKit" align="left" style="margin:10px"><br>
<br>
Note that if a thug dies they are cheaply replaced, costing 185gold and 5 wGems for a frost brand.</p>
<br>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p style="text-align:right"> They will be placed in the following formation to allow proper buffing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The thugs will be in the middle of the formation, flanked by both buffing Warrior Sorceresse and a BSgroup.</p>

<p>This was done with an N9W4 bless, but without a bless these blocks are still both cheap and strong.</p>

<h3> Commander Leading </h3>

<p> One of the largest problems with battle management is that cavalry tends to rush infront of the summoned skeletons, leading to an expensive frontline.<br>
The solution to this requires many commanders, approximately one for every 15 units of charge cavalry.<br>
<br><img src="images/tactics/chiefLead.png"><br>
The idea is to have a small group of cavalry on guard commander, with the commander himself on holdx5 attack rear.<br>
This will allow the cavalry to either flank besides friendly skeleton forces, or to merge with the skeletons, giving you a stronger frontline.<br>
